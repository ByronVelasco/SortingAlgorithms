# **InsertionSort**

This module contains the file `InsertionSort.ipynb`, which implements the Insertion Sort algorithm.

## **Insertion Sort Algorithm**

The Insertion Sort algorithm builds the final sorted list one item at a time — like the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

- It starts by assuming the first element is already sorted.

- Then, it picks the next element and compares it to the elements in the sorted portion.

- It inserts the current element into the correct position by shifting the larger elements one step to the right.

- This process continues until all elements are placed in their correct position.

## **Function:** `InsertionSort(A)`

Sorts (ascending) a list `A`. Changes the entire list `A` in-place.

**Example:**
```python
A = [9, 5, 1, 4, 3]
InsertionSort(A)
print(A)
# Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
```

## **Visual Explanation of Insertion Sort**

The image below demonstrates how Insertion Sort builds the sorted portion of the list one element at a time by shifting larger elements to the right and inserting the current element in its correct position.

## **Time Complexity**

- **Best case:** $O(n)$
- **Worst case:** $O(n^2)$
- **Average case:** $O(n^2)$
